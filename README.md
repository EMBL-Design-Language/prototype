A test vision of how the EMBL Design Language could feel in function (not yet in look)

## Building this on your machine

You'll need to build this on your local.

To install:
1. `bower install`
2. `yarn` or `npm install`

To develop:
1. `gulp`: Will build the Sass and serve to your browser with browserSync
2. Edit `index.html`, a file in `./scss` or `./js`
